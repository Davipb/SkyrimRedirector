# Skyrim Redirector
This is an SKSE and SKSE64 plugin that redirects every file I/O in `Skyrim.ini`, `SkyrimPrefs.ini`, and `plugins.txt` to a new path.
It does so  by hooking into the Windows API calls made by the game and changing their target file path if necessary.

This plugin was made for the [Enderal total conversion of Skyrim](http://sureai.net/games/enderal/) and was inspired by [Mod Organizer's 'Hook DLL'](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer-hookdll), which does the same and more as this plugin, but is tied to the Mod Organizer program, and so wasn't suited for including in Enderal.
